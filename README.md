Smily is an Android application that let the user create montages with emojis and edit photos, with an intuitive drag and drop interface.

The user selects the emoji in the slider menu, resize it and rotate it thanks to 2 SeekBars, and drag it to the position of his choice.

The user can finally save his chef-d-oeuvre in his phone gallery.
